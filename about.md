### Why should I read this?

This is for the guys that are hurt, damaged, and broken by someone close in their life. That means guys who don’t know who they are, who know who they are but are too scared to be. This is for those guys. This is for the guy who thinks he’s good enough but knows in his heart that he’s not. 

Who doesn’t ever feel good enough and so hides in his shell and just reacts to stimuli. 

This is for guys who are hurt by your parents. Your dad maybe wasn’t there. Maybe he just wasn’t emotionally available for you. Maybe it was your mom and she never gave you the love that you needed. 

This is for the guys who are struggling to figure out goals, your place in the world. Maybe it’s your marriage, your kids, maybe it’s just growing up. Teenagers, young adults. 

I’m not going to bullshit and say just conquer your fears and you’re good.  
I’m doing this work also at the same time. Some of it’s going to be raw and flat out wrong. I’ll make amends and say hey this didn’t actually work for me. 

But this is about looking into your heart, your brain, and your soul. Finding your unhealthy patterns, finding your healthy behaviors. And magnifying or figuring out the problem why those behaviors are there. Why do you do the things you do? 

You deserve to be loved. You deserve to be truly happy. 

My experience here is gathered from a variety of sources. Thank you Angela Blohm for coming into my life and showing me that I can be better. The book Nice Guys, countless Facebook groups, the biomedicine of the way your brain works. 

The toxic masculinity that you hear about but just can’t seem to shake the stigma of just what that means for such a perfect gentleman such as yourself.
